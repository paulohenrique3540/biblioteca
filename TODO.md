# TODO - Inventory Page Detailed Listings

## Tasks
- [ ] Modify HTML structure in inventario-controle-demo.html to replace single inventory-list with three separate sections
- [ ] Update JavaScript to maintain separate arrays for each category (pending, counted, unassociated tags)
- [ ] Add CSS styling for the new list sections in inventario.css
- [ ] Ensure lists update dynamically during inventory process
- [ ] Test the functionality to ensure proper categorization and display

## Categories to Implement
1. **Livros Pendentes** (Pending Books) - Books not yet counted
2. **Livros Contabilizados** (Counted Books) - Books that have been processed
3. **Tags Não Associadas** (Unassociated Tags) - RFID tags detected but not linked to any book
